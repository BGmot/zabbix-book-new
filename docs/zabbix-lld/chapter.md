# Using Low level discovery to automate

In this chapter, we'll dive into **Low-Level Discovery (LLD)**, covering everything
there is to know about this powerful feature in Zabbix. LLD automates the creation
of hosts, items, triggers, and more, simplifying the management of large and
dynamic environments.

We'll also explain how to work with **custom JSON** in the context of LLD, showing
you how to tailor discovery rules to fit your unique needs. By mastering these
techniques, you'll be able to create highly adaptable monitoring setups that
respond to changes in your infrastructure with minimal manual intervention.

By the end of this chapter, you'll have a deep understanding of LLD, from basic
concepts to advanced customization, enabling you to leverage its full potential
in your Zabbix deployment.
