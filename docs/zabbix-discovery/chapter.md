# Automating Your Monitoring with Auto Discovery and Active Agent Auto Registration

In this chapter, we'll explore two powerful automation features in Zabbix:
**auto discovery** and **active agent auto-registration**. These tools are essential
for scaling your monitoring efforts by minimizing manual configuration and
ensuring new devices and services are seamlessly integrated into your Zabbix
environment.

We'll begin with **auto discovery**, which enables Zabbix to automatically detect
and monitor new hosts and services within your network. You'll learn how to
configure discovery rules, actions, and conditions to automate the onboarding
process, making your monitoring more dynamic and adaptive to changes in your
infrastructure.

Next, we'll dive into **active agent auto registration**, which simplifies the
management of Zabbix agents, especially in large or rapidly changing environments.
We'll cover how to set up auto-registration rules that allow agents to register
themselves with the Zabbix server, reducing administrative overhead and ensuring
all relevant data is captured efficiently.

By the end of this chapter, you'll have a thorough understanding of how to leverage
auto-discovery and auto-registration to create a more automated, scalable, and
efficient monitoring system.
