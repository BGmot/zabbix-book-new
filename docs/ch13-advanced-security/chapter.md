# Advanced set-up and security

In today's interconnected IT landscape, monitoring systems like Zabbix have become
critical infrastructure components, offering visibility into the health and performance
of entire networks. However, these powerful monitoring tools also represent potential
security vulnerabilities if not properly secured. This chapter will explores the
essential combination of SELinux and security best practices to harden your Zabbix
deployment against modern threats.

Security is not an optional feature but a fundamental requirement for any monitoring
solution. Zabbix, with its extensive reach across your infrastructure, has access
to sensitive system information and often operates with elevated privileges.
Without proper security controls, a compromised monitoring system can become a
launchpad for lateral movement across your network, potentially exposing critical
business data and systems.

We'll explore how SELinux's mandatory access control framework provides an additional
security layer beyond traditional permissions, and how proper configuration can
dramatically reduce your attack surface. You'll learn practical, implementable
security measures that balance protection with functionality, ensuring your monitoring
capabilities remain intact while defending against both external and internal threats.

Whether you're a system administrator, security professional, or IT manager, understanding
these security principles will help you transform your Zabbix deployment from a
potential liability into a secure asset within your security architecture.
