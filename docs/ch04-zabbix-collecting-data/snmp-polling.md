# SNMP Polling

In the previous chapter, we explored monitoring strategies that relied on both
active and passive Zabbix agents. This chapter introduces an alternative approach
monitoring via SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol) which does not require
the installation of a Zabbix agent on the monitored device. This method is
especially useful in environments where agent based monitoring is impractical,
restricted or simply not allowed.

Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is a widely adopted protocol designed
for monitoring and managing devices on IP networks. Despite the word "management"
in its name, SNMP is predominantly employed for monitoring purposes. Its widespread
support across networking hardware and embedded systems has made it a cornerstone
of modern network visibility solutions.

Originally developed in the late 1980s, SNMP has undergone several revisions.
Early versions, such as SNMPv1 and SNMPv2c, were hampered by significant security
limitations. As a result, while SNMP includes functionality for remote device
configuration, its use has remained largely to status monitoring rather than
active management of devices.

SNMP is especially valuable for monitoring resource constrained or embedded devices
that lack the capacity to run a full monitoring agent.

Common examples include:

- Printers
- Network switches, routers, and firewalls
- Uninterruptible Power Supplies (UPSs)
- NAS (Network-Attached Storage) appliances
- Environmental sensors (e.g., temperature, humidity sensors)

These devices often provide built-in SNMP support, making them accessible for monitoring
with minimal configuration. Additionally, SNMP can be employed on standard servers
where installing or maintaining a Zabbix agent is either impractical or not permitted.
This could be due to administrative policies, software compatibility or security
concerns, or simply a desire to reduce system footprint.

Recognizing the ubiquity of SNMP, Zabbix provides native SNMP support. This
capability is powered by the open-source Net-SNMP suite, available at
[http://net-snmp.sourceforge.net](http://net-snmp.sourceforge.net). The integration
allows Zabbix to retrieve metrics from SNMP-enabled devices using industry standard
mechanisms.

In this chapter, we will cover the following:

- An introduction to the Net-SNMP toolkit and its core utilities.
- How to integrate MIB (Management Information Base) files into Zabbix, enabling
  the platform to interpret SNMP data correctly.
- The process of SNMP polling within Zabbix, including how to define SNMP-based
  items and retrieve data from devices.

This chapter serves as the foundation for SNMP-based monitoring in Zabbix. While
we begin with the essentials such as polling, MIB usage, and SNMP item
configuration this is just the start.

Later in this book, we will build upon this knowledge by exploring Low-Level
Discovery (LLD) mechanisms using SNMP. LLD allows Zabbix to automatically detect
and create monitoring items for dynamic or repetitive structures, such as
network interfaces, power supplies, ...

## What is a MIB?

Imagine you have a house full of smart devices: a smart thermostat, a smart lamp,
and a smart doorbell. All these devices keep track of various types of information.
The thermostat has the indoor temperature and battery status, the lamp has its
brightness and color, and the doorbell has a log of who has been at the door.

A MIB (Management Information Base) is the "table of contents" or "catalog" of
all this information on a network device. Every SNMP enabled device has its own
MIB, which is structured and organized. Without a MIB, your Zabbix server wouldn't
know what data is available to monitor. The MIB specifies exactly which metrics
the device can share.

---

## What is an OID?

To retrieve a specific piece of information from that catalog, you need an address.
An OID (Object Identifier) is that address.

You can think of an OID as a GPS coordinate or a book's unique ISBN number. It's
a hierarchical sequence of numbers (for example, 1.3.6.1.2.1.1.3.0) that leads
you to one specific piece of information, such as a device's uptime or the
number of network errors on a particular port.

The OID is the exact path to the data within the MIB. Zabbix uses these OIDs
to know what to request from the device. You configure Zabbix to say: "Request
the value of this specific OID," and the device returns the requested value.

In short:

- The MIB is the library catalog that describes the structure of all available
  data.
- The OID is the specific address that leads you to the book (the data) you're
  looking for.

When Zabbix wants to monitor a device via SNMP, it uses an OID to send an SNMP
request. The agent on the device searches its MIB for the data corresponding
to that OID and sends the value back to Zabbix. This is the foundation of
SNMP based monitoring.

---

### What Is the OID Tree Structure?

The OID (Object Identifier) structure is a hierarchical tree, much like a family
tree or a computer's folder structure. This tree is standardized globally. Each
point on the tree, from the root to the "leaves," is represented by a number.

The tree starts at the root, with a few main branches managed by international
organizations. The most common branch for network management and SNMP often begins
with `1.3.6.1`. Let's break down this OID to see how the structure works:

- **1:** This branch is managed by **ISO** (International Organization for Standardization).
- **1.3:** This branch is for `identified-organization`.
- **1.3.6:** This is the branch for the U.S. Department of Defense (**DoD**).
- **1.3.6.1:** This is the **internet** branch, managed by the IETF (Internet
  Engineering Task Force).
- ... and so on.

Every branch in this tree is responsible for managing the numbers below it. Companies
like Cisco or projects like Net-SNMP get their own unique number under a specific
branch, most commonly under `1.3.6.1.4.1`, which is reserved for private enterprises.

---

### How to Use the OID Tree

For Zabbix, the OID tree is essential for understanding what data is available on
a device. Instead of remembering long, unreadable strings of numbers, **MIB
(Management Information Base)** files use text labels to translate the numbers
into human-readable names.

**Example:**

- The OID for a device's system description is: `1.3.6.1.2.1.1.1.0`.
- An MIB file translates this to: `sysDescr.0`.

You can use the OID tree to:

1. **Look up data manually**: You can browse MIB files or online OID databases to
   find the exact OID for the metric you want to monitor.
2. **Use SNMP commands**: With commands like `snmpwalk`, `snmpget`, or `snmpstatus`,
   you can use the numeric OIDs or the readable names (if MIBs are loaded) to
   request data from a device.
3. **Configure LLD (Low-Level Discovery)**: Zabbix uses OID sub-trees to automatically
   create monitoring items for dynamic components, such as network interfaces or
   disk partitions.

## Net-SNMP

The Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is a widely used protocol for monitoring
and managing networked devices. It operates primarily over UDP port 161, though in
certain cases, SNMP agents or proxies may also support TCP port 161 for enhanced
reliability or integration with specific tools. SNMP allows administrators to query
information or trigger actions on remote devices using structured data identified
by Object Identifiers (OIDs).

To begin working with SNMP in a lab or testing environment, you may choose between
two approaches:

- Use an existing SNMP capable device already present in your network infrastructure.
- Deploy a lightweight SNMP agent on a general-purpose server, such as your Zabbix
  server or a dedicated virtual machine.

In this chapter, we will walk through the installation and configuration of a basic
SNMP agent on a Rocky or Ubuntu based Zabbix server. However, the same setup can
be applied to any compatible Linux system.

Note: If you're using a device already present on your network, ensure:

- You have network access to the device (verify routing and firewall settings).
- SNMP access is allowed from your Zabbix serverâ€™s IP address.
- The correct community string is configured, and your IP is included in the SNMP
  access control rules of the device.

Dataflow between Zabbix and the SNMP device.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Zabbix Server] -->|SNMP Request on port 161/UDP| B(Router, Switch, Printer, ...);
    B -->|SNMP Agent| C{"Management Information Base (MIB)"};
    C -->|Read data via OID's| B;
    B -->|SNMP Response| A
```

Before we start lets go over a few tools that we will use and explain what they
exactly do.

- **snmpget:** Retrieves the value of a single, specific OID.
- **snmpwalk:** Walks an entire OID subtree and displays all of its values.
- **snmpstatus:** Provides a summary of a device's basic status.

### Testing an SNMP Device: Where to Start?

When you're looking to test an SNMP device, it's crucial to understand the available
SNMP versions and which ones you should prioritize. Currently, there are three
commonly used versions: **SNMPv1**, **SNMPv2c**, and **SNMPv3**.

- **SNMPv1**: This is the oldest version and should generally be avoided unless
  absolutely necessary. It's quite limited in functionality and has serious security
  vulnerabilities.
- **SNMPv2c**: Still the most prevalent version today, SNMPv2c offers improvements
  over v1, especially in data retrieval and performance. It's relatively straightforward
  to configure and use.
- **SNMPv3**: This version is rapidly gaining popularity and is considered the most
  secure and advanced option. It provides encryption, authentication, and user
  management, which are essential for secure networks.

#### Your First Test Attempt: SNMPv2c and the 'public' Community String

To begin your testing, we recommend trying to connect to your device using **SNMPv2c**
and the standard **community string 'public'**. Many devices ship with these default
settings, though it's certainly insecure for production environments.

You can use the `snmpstatus` command for this. Hereâ€™s an example of how you might
do this in your terminal:

```bash
   snmpstatus -v 2c -c public [IP-address_of_the_device]
```

Replace `[IP-address_of_the_device]` with the actual IP address or hostname of the
device you wish to test.

#### What if You Get No Information Back?

If you don't receive any information after this attempt, don't panic. It simply means
the default settings likely don't apply to your device, or there might be a network
related issue. You'll need to dig deeper into your device's configuration or troubleshoot
your network.

**First, check the device's configuration:**

1. **SNMP Version**: Which SNMP version (v1, v2c, or v3) is configured and enabled?
2. **Community String (for v1/v2c)**: If your device uses SNMPv1 or SNMPv2c, what
   is the configured community string (similar to a password) for read-only and
   potentially read- write access? It's rarely 'public' in a properly configured
   environment.
3. **Username, Authentication, and Privacy (for v3)**: If your device uses SNMPv3,
   you'll need more specific information:
   - **Username**: What username has been created for SNMPv3?
   - **Authentication Protocol and Password**: Which authentication protocol (e.g.,
     MD5, SHA) is used, and what is its corresponding password?
   - **Privacy Protocol and Password**: Which encryption protocol (e.g., DES, AES)
     is used, and what is its corresponding password?

**Next, consider potential network issues:**

Even if your device is correctly configured, network obstacles can prevent SNMP communication.
Check for:

- **Firewall Blocking**: A firewall (either on your testing machine, the network,
  or the SNMP device itself) might be blocking the UDP port 161, which SNMP typically
  uses. Ensure the necessary ports are open.
- **ACL Settings on the Device**: The SNMP device itself might have Access Control
  List (ACL) settings configured to restrict access only to specific IP addresses.
  Verify that your testing machine's IP address is permitted.
- **Network Connectivity**: Basic network issues like incorrect IP addresses, subnet
  masks, or routing problems can also prevent communication. Ensure there's a clear
  network path between your testing machine and the SNMP device.

---

### SNMPv3 Security Levels

SNMPv3 offers significant security enhancements over older, unsecured versions
(SNMPv1 and SNMPv2c). The protocol has three security levels:

- **noAuthNoPriv (Authentication and encryption off):** This is the least secure
  level. There's no authentication and no encryption. It's similar to SNMPv1
  and SNMPv2c and offers no protection. It should only be used in strictly
  controlled lab environments where security is not a concern.

- **authNoPriv (Authentication on, encryption off):** This level authenticates
  the user, which guarantees data integrity. It verifies that messages come from
  a trusted source and haven't been tampered with. However, the data isn't
  encrypted, so it remains readable if the traffic is intercepted. This level
  is suitable for non-sensitive data in a relatively secure network. Authentication
  protocols used here are typically MD5 or SHA.

- **authPriv (Authentication and encryption on):** This is the most secure and
  recommended level. It provides both authentication and data encryption.
  Authentication ensures the integrity and origin of the message, while encryption
  makes the data unreadable to third parties. This is essential for monitoring
  sensitive information or when communicating over unsecured networks. Encryption
  protocols used include DES, 3DES, and AES.

---

#### Examples of SNMPv3 Commands

Once you have the necessary information (and have ruled out network issues), you
can try connecting with SNMPv3. Here are some examples of how you might use `snmpstatus`
with SNMPv3 (depending on your configuration):

- **Authentication only (no encryption):**

  ```bash
     snmpstatus -v 3 -l authNoPriv -u [username] -a [authentication_protocol] -A [authentication_password]
     [IP-address_of_the_device]
  ```

  (Replace `[authentication_protocol]` with `MD5` or `SHA`)

- **Authentication and Encryption:**

  ```bash
     snmpstatus -v 3 -l authPriv -u [username] -a [authentication_protocol] -A [authentication_password]
     -x [privacy_protocol] -X [privacy_wachtwoord] [IP-address_of_the_device]
  ```

  (Replace `[authentication_protocol]` with `MD5` or `SHA` and `[privacy_protocol]`
  with `DES` or `AES`)

---

### A Note on SNMPv1: Avoid if Possible

While you can technically test with SNMPv1, we strongly advise against using it
in production. SNMPv1 is an outdated and insecure protocol version vulnerable to
various attacks. Always try to connect with v2c or v3 first. Only if you are absolutely
certain that the device exclusively supports SNMPv1 and you have no other option,
you can try using it:

```bash
    snmpstatus -v 1 -c [community_string] [IP-address_of_the_device]
```

However, remember that using SNMPv1 in a production environment poses a significant
security risk.

---

### Understanding the Output of snmpstatus

Let's take a look at an example output from the `snmpstatus` command. Remember
this is just an example output it will differ from your result.

```bash
    snmpstatus -v2c -c public 127.0.0.1
    [UDP: [127.0.0.1]:161->[0.0.0.0]:33310]=>[Linux localhost.localdomain 5.14.0-570.28.1.el9_6.aarch64
    #1 SMP PREEMPT_DYNAMIC Thu Jul 24 07:50:10 EDT 2025 aarch64] Up: 1:24:36.58
    Interfaces: 2, Recv/Trans packets: 355763/355129 | IP: 37414/35988
```

This output provides a concise summary of the device's status, indicating a successful
SNMP query. Let's break down what each part means:

1. **`snmpstatus -v2c -c public 127.0.0.1`**:

   - `-v2c`: Specifies that SNMP version 2c was used.
   - `-c public`: Indicates that the community string "public" was used for authentication.
   - `127.0.0.1`: This is the target IP address, in this case, the localhost (the
     machine on which the command was run).

2. **`[UDP: [127.0.0.1]:161->[0.0.0.0]:33310]`**:

   - This section describes the communication path.
   - `UDP`: Confirms that the User Datagram Protocol was used, which is standard
     for SNMP.
   - `[127.0.0.1]:161`: This is the source of the SNMP request and the standard
     SNMP port (161) on which the SNMP agent listens.
   - `->[0.0.0.0]:33310`: This indicates the destination of the response. `0.0.0.0`
     is a placeholder for "any address," and `33310` is a high-numbered ephemeral
     port used by the client to receive the response.

3. **`=>[Linux localhost.localdomain 5.14.0-570.28.1.el9_6.aarch64 #1 SMP PREEMPT
_DYNAMIC Thu Jul 24 07:50:10 EDT 2025 aarch64]`**:

   - This is crucial information about the queried device itself.
   - `Linux localhost.localdomain`: Identifies the operating system as Linux, with
     the hostname `localhost.localdomain`.
   - `5.14.0-570.28.1.el9_6.aarch64`: This is the kernel version and architecture
   - `#1 SMP PREEMPT_DYNAMIC Thu Jul 24 07:50:10 EDT 2025 aarch64`: Provides further
     kernel build details, including the build date and time.

4. **`Up: 1:24:36.58`**:

   - This indicates the **uptime** of the device. The system has been running for
     1 day, 24 hours, 36 minutes, and 58 seconds.

5. **`Interfaces: 2, Recv/Trans packets: 355763/355129 | IP: 37414/35988`**:

   - **`Interfaces: 2`**: This tells us that the device has detected 2 network interfaces.
   - **`Recv/Trans packets: 355763/355129`**: These numbers represent the total
     number of packets received and transmitted across _all_ network interfaces
     on the device since it was last booted.
   - **`IP: 37414/35988`**: These figures likely represent the number of IP datagrams
     received and sent specifically by the IP layer on the device. This provides
     a more specific metric of IP traffic compared to the total packet count
     which includes other layer 2 protocols.

In summary, this output from `snmpstatus` quickly provides a clear overview of a
Linux system's basic health and network activity, confirming that the SNMP agent
is reachable and responding with the requested information using SNMPv2c.

### Installing SNMP Agent on a Linux Host

Now that we know a bit more about SNMP it's time to start playing next we will
install the SNMP agent and utilities on our Zabbix server to do some testing.
Or another compatible system if you prefer.

Follow the steps below to get the SNMP agent installed.

1. Install Required Packages

!!! info "Update the package list"

    Red Hat
    ``` bash
    sudo dnf update
    ```

    Ubuntu:
    ``` bash
    sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
    ```

!!! info "Install Net-SNMP agent and utilities"

    Red Hat
    ```bash
    sudo dnf install net-snmp net-snmp-utils
    ```

    Ubuntu
    ``` bash
    Todo
    ```

2. Configure the SNMP Agent
   First, create a clean configuration file for the SNMP daemon:

```bash
    sudo vi /etc/snmp/snmpd.conf
```

Paste the following example configuration, which is optimized for SNMP-based
discovery and testing in Zabbix:

```bash
tee /etc/snmp/snmpd.conf <<EOF
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
# BASIC ACCESS CONTROL
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This defines who has access and with which community string.
# For a LAB ENVIRONMENT, 'public' is acceptable, but EMPHASIZE THAT THIS IS UNSAFE
# FOR PRODUCTION. In production, use SNMPv3 or restricted IP ranges.

# Read-only community string 'public' for all IP addresses (WARNING: LAB USE ONLY!)
rocommunity public
#
# IMPORTANT NOTE: The 'public' community string is the default and most well-known community string.
# Using this in a production environment is EXTREMELY INSECURE and makes your device vulnerable.
# Anyone who knows your device's IP address can query basic information about your system.
# USE THIS ONLY AND EXCLUSIVELY IN STRICTLY ISOLATED TEST OR LAB ENVIRONMENTS!
# For production environments:
# - Use a unique, complex community string (e.g., rocommunity YourSuperSecretString)
# - STRONGLY CONSIDER implementing SNMPv3 for superior security (authentication and encryption).
#

# BETTER FOR LAB (or production with restrictions):
# rocommunity my_secure_community_string 192.168.56.0/24
# Replace '192.168.56.0/24' with the subnet where your Zabbix Server is located.


# ============================================
# SNMPv3 Configuration (Recommended for Production, but here with examples)
# ============================================
#
# This section defines users for SNMPv3, each with a different security level.
# In a production environment, you would typically ONLY use the 'authPriv' option
# with strong, unique passwords. This setup is useful for lab and testing purposes.

# --- 1. SNMPv3 User with Authentication and Privacy (authPriv) ---
# THIS IS THE MOST SECURE AND RECOMMENDED SECURITY LEVEL FOR PRODUCTION.
# It requires both correct authentication and encryption of the traffic.
#
# Syntax: createUser USERNAME AUTH_PROTOCOL "AUTH_PASS" PRIV_PROTOCOL "PRIV_PASS"
# Example: createUser mysecureuser SHA "StrongAuthP@ss1" AES "SuperPrivP@ss2"

createUser secureuser SHA "AuthP@ssSec#1" AES "PrivP@ssSec#2"
rouser secureuser authPriv

# --- 2. SNMPv3 User with Authentication Only (authNoPriv) ---
# This level requires authentication, but the data is NOT encrypted.
# The content of SNMP packets can be read if traffic is intercepted.
# NOT RECOMMENDED FOR SENSITIVE DATA OR PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENTS.
#
# Syntax: createUser USERNAME AUTH_PROTOCOL "AUTH_PASS"
# Example: createUser authonlyuser SHA "AuthOnlyP@ss3"

createUser authonlyuser SHA "AuthOnlyP@ss3"
rouser authonlyuser authNoPriv

# --- 3. SNMPv3 User with [48;32;186;960;2604tNo Authentication and No Privacy (noAuthNoPriv) ---
# THIS IS THE LEAST SECURE LEVEL AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED IN PRODUCTION!
# It offers NO SECURITY WHATSOEVER. It's purely for very specific test scenarios
# where security is not a concern.
#
# Syntax: createUser USERNAME
# Example: createUser insecureuser

createUser insecureuser
rouser insecureuser noAuthNoPriv

#
# IMPORTANT SECURITY NOTES FOR ALL SNMPv3 USERS:
# - Replace the example usernames and passwords with your OWN strong, unique values.
# - Passwords must be a MINIMUM of 8 characters long.
# - The passwords for AUTH and PRIV (with authPriv) do not have to be the same.
# - Restrict access to specific IP addresses (e.g., 'rouser USERNAME authPriv 192.168.1.0/24')
#   if you want to further tighten access.
#


# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
# SYSTEM INFORMATION (OPTIONAL)
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This information is generally available via SNMP and useful for identification.
syslocation  "Rocky Linux Zabbix SNMP Lab Server"
syscontact   "Your Name <your.email@example.com>"
sysname      "RockySNMPHost01" # Often overridden by hostname, but can be specific

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
# ENABLING CRUCIAL MIB MODULES FOR LLD
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 'view' statements determine which parts of the MIB tree are visible.
# 'systemview' is a standard view. We ensure that the most useful OID trees
# for Zabbix LLD are included here.

# Standard System MIBs (uptime, description, etc.)
view systemview included .1.3.6.1.2.1.1    # SNMPv2-MIB::sysDescr, sysUptime, etc.

# HOST-RESOURCES-MIB: ESSENTIAL FOR LLD OF HARDWARE/OS COMPONENTS
# This MIB contains information about storage (filesystems), processors,
# installed software, running processes, etc.
view systemview included .1.3.6.1.2.1.25

# IF-MIB: ESSENTIAL FOR LLD OF NETWORK INTERFACES
# Contains detailed information about network interfaces.
view systemview included .1.3.6.1.2.1.2

# Other useful MIBs (often standard or optional)
view systemview included .1.3.6.1.2.1.4
view systemview included .1.3.6.1.2.1.6
view systemview included .1.3.6.1.2.1.7

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
# EXTENDING SNMPD WITH EXEC COMMANDS (OPTIONAL FOR CUSTOM LLD)
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This allows you to make the output of shell commands or scripts available via SNMP.
# This is ideal for monitoring things not natively available via SNMP.
# Example: Monitor the number of logged-in users (not LLD, but demonstrates the principle)
# exec activeUsers /usr/bin/who | wc -l

# Example: A script that generates LLD-like output
# imagine /opt/scripts/docker_lld.sh returns JSON that Zabbix can parse
# exec dockerContainers /opt/scripts/docker_lld.sh
# This requires a custom LLD parser in Zabbix. For an introduction, this
# might be a bit too advanced, but it's good to mention as a possibility.

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
# SYSLOGGING
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
# For logging snmpd activities (useful for debugging)
dontLogTCPWrappers no
EOF
```

Let's do some practical tests with this setup we just created. Start the SNMP Service
and Configure the Firewall

```bash
# Start the SNMP daemon
sudo systemctl start snmpd
```

```bash
# Enable it to start on boot
sudo systemctl enable snmpd
```

```bash
# Check that the service is running
sudo systemctl status snmpd
If your system uses firewalld, ensure that SNMP traffic is allowed:
```

```bash
# Add SNMP to permanent firewall rules
sudo firewall-cmd --add-service=snmp --permanent
```

```bash
# Reload the firewall configuration
sudo firewall-cmd --reload
```

```bash
# Confirm that SNMP is listed
sudo firewall-cmd --list-services --permanent
```

```bash
Verifying SNMP Functionality
From your Zabbix server or any SNMP client system with net-snmp-utils installed:

# Repace <IP_ADDRESS> wit the IP of the client where you installed the SNMP
# config. If localhost you can use 127.0.0.1.

# General system info (sysDescr, sysUptime, etc.)
snmpwalk -v2c -c public <IP_ADDRESS> .1.3.6.1.2.1.1

# List interface names (useful for interface LLD)
snmpwalk -v2c -c public <IP_ADDRESS> .1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.2

# List filesystem descriptions
snmpwalk -v2c -c public <IP_ADDRESS> .1.3.6.1.2.1.25.2.3.1.3

# Get CPU load per processor core
snmpwalk -v2c -c public <IP_ADDRESS> .1.3.6.1.2.1.25.3.3.1.2
```

???+ note

    For SNMPv3 we can do the same. You could adapt the configuration file or just
    go with what we have prepared already in the snmpd.conf file.

```bash
vi /etc/snmp/snmpd.conf

# Look for the following lines and adapt them as you like.

createUser authonlyuser SHA "AuthOnlyP@ss3"
rouser authonlyuser authNoPriv

createUser secureuser SHA "AuthP@ssSec#1" AES "PrivP@ssSec#2"
rouser secureuser authPriv

createUser insecureuser
rouser insecureuser noAuthNoPriv
```

After you have adapted your config don't forget to restart the snmpd service

```bash
systemctl restart snmpd
```

You should now be able to test your items with SNMPv3 Let me give you an example
command for noAuthNoPriv,authNoPriv and the most secure authPriv. This should
work out of the box with what is already configured in our `snmpd.conf` file.

```bash
snmpwalk -v3 -l noAuthNoPriv -u insecureuser 127.0.0.1 .1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.2
snmpwalk -v3 -l authNoPriv -u authonlyuser -a SHA -A AuthOnlyP@ss3 127.0.0.1 .1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.2
snmpwalk -v3 -l authPriv -u secureuser -a SHA -A AuthP@ssSec#1 -x AES -X PrivP@ssSec#2 127.0.0.1 .1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.2
```

???+ note

    If you change the config file and adapt the passwords and for some reason
    they do not get accepted do not worry just restart the service again it things
    still don't work you can remove the persistent key file
    sudo rm /var/lib/net-snmp/snmpd.conf
    It's quite brutal but in our test environment it will help you out.

## **SNMP Monitoring in Zabbix**

Now that we have covered how SNMP works, it's time to put that knowledge into
practice. We'll start up our Zabbix instance and begin monitoring, but first,
it's crucial to understand the two different methods Zabbix offers for retrieving
SNMP information from a device.

---

#### **Legacy SNMP Monitoring**

The traditional method for SNMP monitoring is synchronous. It uses a **single OID**
placed directly into the item's SNMP OID field. Zabbix will wait for a response
before it moves on to the next check.

- **OID**: A single textual or numeric OID is used to retrieve a single value synchronously.
  For example: `1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.1.1.6.3`.
- The timeout for these items is governed by the `Timeout` parameter in the **Zabbix
  server configuration file**. To make this method functional, the `StartPollers`
  parameter must also be correctly configured.

When we talk about bulk processing in legacy it can be interesting to have a look
at the Zabbix documentation about this subject.

#### **Asynchronous SNMP Monitoring (Recommended)**

The newer, **recommended** approach is asynchronous and provides much better
performance. It leverages native SNMP bulk requests (`GetBulkRequest-PDUs`).

- **`walk[OID1, OID2, ...]`**: This retrieves a subtree of values. For
  **example:** `walk[1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.2,1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.3]`.
- **`get[OID]`**: This retrieves a single value asynchronously. For **example:**
  `get[1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.1.1.6.3]`.

With asynchronous monitoring, timeout settings can be configured per item. It's
best to set a low timeout value to avoid long delays if a device is unreachable,
as Zabbix will attempt up to 5 retries. A 3-second timeout, for instance, could
result in a 15-second wait.

All `walk[OID]` and `get[OID]` items are executed asynchronously, meaning Zabbix
does not need to wait for one response before starting other checks. DNS resolution
is also handled asynchronously. The maximum concurrency for these checks is 1000,
defined by the `MaxConcurrentChecksPerPoller` parameter. The number of SNMP pollers
dedicated to this method is set by the `StartSNMPPollers` parameter.

### **Polling Your First OID in Zabbix**

Let's begin by polling our first OID in Zabbix. As you may recall from a previous
`snmpwalk` command, querying `.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.2` returned two results, identifying
the network interfaces on the device:

- `IF-MIB::ifDescr.1 = STRING: lo`
- `IF-MIB::ifDescr.2 = STRING: enp0s1`

To find the inbound and outbound octets for the `enp0s1` network card, we need
to locate the correct OID. While a MIB file would provide a clear map of all
available OIDs, this isn't always an option. A common method to discover the
correct OID is to perform a broader `snmpwalk` by removing the last digit
from the initial OID.

```bash
snmpwalk -v2c -c public <IP_ADDRESS> .1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1
```

This command returns a more extensive list of MIB objects.

```bash
IF-MIB::ifIndex.1 = INTEGER: 1
IF-MIB::ifIndex.2 = INTEGER: 2
IF-MIB::ifDescr.1 = STRING: lo
IF-MIB::ifDescr.2 = STRING: enp0s1
...
IF-MIB::ifInOctets.1 = Counter32: 697830615
IF-MIB::ifInOctets.2 = Counter32: 49954965
...
```

From this output, we can see that the index for our target network card, `enp0s1`,
is `2`. This confirms that we can use this index to find the correct data. The
output `IF-MIB::ifInOctets.2 = Counter32: 49954965` appears to be the value
we need, but this is not the raw OID.

To convert this human-readable output into a numerical OID that Zabbix can use,
we can add the `-On` flag to our `snmpwalk` command, which converts the output
to its numerical form.

```bash
snmpwalk -v2c -c public <IP_ADDRESS> IF-MIB::ifInOctets.2 -On
```

The result is the specific OID for the inbound octets on the `enp0s1` interface:

```bash
.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.10.2 = Counter32: 50050587
```

This is the OID you would use to configure an SNMP item in Zabbix to monitor the
network traffic for this specific interface.
