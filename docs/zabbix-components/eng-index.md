# Zabbix components, basic functions and installation

This chapter details what is currently in Getting started. It is meant as not only
the basic installation part, but also to detail more clearly the detailed components
that Zabbix offers, what they do. Explain things like sub processes, good architecture
choices etc.

It should be a good mix of “I just want to install Zabbix” and “I really want to make
the right architecture choices and learn more on the functioning of Zabbix components”.
Beginners and Advanced users alike can get something from it.
