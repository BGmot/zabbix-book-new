# Building and using templates

A great way to guide users towards a **deeper understanding of Zabbix** is by
initially holding off on templates and gradually introducing them much like in
formal training. In this chapter, we'll start by explaining the **basic usage
of default templates** and how to find new ones, helping you get up and running
with minimal effort.

Once you're comfortable with default templates, we’ll dive into **building your
own templates**, offering detailed instructions on customization and best practices.
We’ll also cover how to **share your templates** within the Zabbix community,
fostering collaboration and knowledge exchange.

To round off, we'll feature **Tags and Macros**, explaining their roles within
templates and why they're most effective when understood in the context of
template usage. This structured approach will ensure you grasp the full potential
of templates and their associated features in Zabbix.

By the end of this chapter, you'll be well versed in both using and creating templates,
equipped to enhance your monitoring setup and contribute to the broader Zabbix ecosystem.
