# Triggers
In the previous chapter we have been hard at work to collect our data from various monitoring targets. Because of that our Zabbix environment is filled with useful and important information about our IT infrastructure. However, when you want to know something about your various different devices and applications you have to go through a mountain of data. This is where triggers come in.

Triggers in Zabbix work as a way for us to collect a mountain worth of data, while being alerted about what's important. It allows us to set our own expressions that will define exactly when Zabbix should log and alert us about something happening with our data. The easiest example being something like a CPU going to 90% utilization.


## Creating your first trigger
In the previous chapter we created some hosts to monitor the Zabbix agent, which are great for some example triggers. Let's grab one of these hosts and create a new item on it, specifically to monitor the CPU load in percentage.
