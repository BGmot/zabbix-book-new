# Collecting data with your Zabbix environment

In this chapter, we'll take a **detailed journey through Zabbix data flow**,
showing how to progress from an empty setup to a fully functioning system capable
of sending timely notifications. Weâ€™ll break down each step, giving you a clear
understanding of how data moves through Zabbix.

We'll then explore the **various protocols** used in Zabbix, how they function,
their compatibility with different components, and how to configure them effectively.
This will provide you with a comprehensive overview of the communication backbone
that powers Zabbix monitoring capabilities.

Next, we'll cover the essentials like **hosts, host groups, host interfaces**,
and **items**, ensuring you understand their roles and how to set them up correctly. 

For now, we'll hold off on **custom scripts and external check items**, focusing
instead on the core elements. When we touch on **active agents**, we'll reference
the chapter on auto-registration, guiding you to more detailed discussions on
that topic later.

By the end of this chapter, you'll have a strong grasp of Zabbix data flow and
the protocols that enable seamless monitoring and notifications, preparing you
for more advanced configurations and integrations.
