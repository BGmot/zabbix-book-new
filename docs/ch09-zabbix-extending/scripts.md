# Frontend Scripts

So, you're diving into the world of Zabbix frontend scripts, and you're in for 
a treat! These little powerhouses unlock a whole new level of flexibility within
your Zabbix environment. Imagine being able to trigger custom actions directly from
your Zabbix interface â€“ whether it's as an action operation responding to an alert,
a manual intervention on a host, or a targeted response to a specific event.

What's truly exciting is *where* you can weave these scripts into your daily Zabbix
workflow. Picture adding custom menu items right within your **Hosts**, **Problems**,
**Dashboards**, and even your **Maps** sections. This means the information and
tools you need are always at your fingertips.

Ultimately, frontend scripts empower you to extend Zabbix far beyond it's out-of-the-box
capabilities. They provide that crucial extra layer of customization, allowing you
to seamlessly integrate your own scripts and workflows directly into the Zabbix
frontend. Get ready to harness this power and tailor Zabbix precisely to your needs!

## Creating a frontend scripts

For this example we will make use of a frontend script I made to put hosts in
maintenance mode. This allow us with frontend scripts to create an option to execute
this script from our GUI and place the host in maintenance. it can be downloaded
from my GitHub page here :
[https://github.com/Trikke76/Zabbix/blob/master/maintenance/zabbix-maintenance.py](https://github.com/Trikke76/Zabbix/blob/master/maintenance/zabbix-maintenance.py)

!!! info "Download this script and place it in `/usr/bin/` "
    ```
    cd /usr/bin/
    sudo dnf install wget -y
    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Trikke76/Zabbix/refs/heads/master/maintenance/zabbix-maintenance.py -P /usr/bin/
    sudo dnf install python3-requests -y
    chmod +x /usr/bin/zabbix-maintenance.py
    ```

Our python script is making use of an extra package we need to install some python
package before we can run our script.

!!! info "install python3-requests"
    Redhat
    ```
    dnf install python3-requests
    ```
    Ubuntu
    ```
    todo
    ```

???+ note
    For the user you can use the user `Admin` or you can create a new user. but
    make sure this user has enough permissions to create a maintenance mode.
    It's best practice to create a dedicated user for this in production.

Since Zabbix 7.2 we need to use a token to authenticate with our API. Every user
can create it's own tokens and the `Super admin` is able to manage them.
Let's create a token for our user `Admin`. Go to `User settings` -> `API tokens`.

![User API](ch09-scripts-user.png)

*9.1 User API*

After we select `API tokens` from the menu we arrive on the `API tokens` page.
Click on the top right button `Create API token`.

![Create API](ch09-create-api.png)

*9.2 Create API page*

A new popup will appear to create a new API token. We have to fill a unique `Name`.
We have the option to disable the token after some time but in our case we keep
it active for an unlimited time.

![New API token](ch09-new-api-token.png)

*9.3 Create new API token*

A new popup will appear to tell us the API token was created and we will see 
an `Auth token` generated by Zabbix. Take note of this token as once you press
`close` the token will be invisible in the frontend and there is no way to make
it visible again. The only way will be to create a new token and delete the old
token.

![API Token Created](ch09-api-token-added.png)

*9.4 Added API token*


The next step is to edit our script and change the variables with the correct url
and token. Be careful to use HTTP or HTTPS depending on what you use:

!!! info "Replace variables"
    ```
    sudo vi /usr/bin/zabbix-maintenance.py
    ```
    ```
    ZABBIX_API_URL = "https://zabbix-url.be/api_jsonrpc.php"
    ZABBIX_API_TOKEN = "API TOKEN"
    ```

Now that we have our script in place it's time to configure our frontend script
in Zabbix. From the Zabbix menu go to `Alerts` => `Scripts`.

![Alerts scripts menu](ch09-Alert-scripts-menu.png)

*9.5 Scripts menu*

You should already see a few existing script  like `Ping`, `Traceroute`, .... that's
normal those where created with the installation of Zabbix. Press the button `Create scripts`
on the top right corner. A now form will popup where we will configure our maintenance
script. Fill out the following fields:

- *Name:* Create maintenance no data collection
- *Scope* : Manual host action
- *Menu path* : Maintenance
- *Type* : Script 
- *Execute on* : Zabbix proxy or server
- *Commands* : `/usr/bin/zabbix-maintenance.py create "{HOST.HOST}" {MANUALINPUT} no`

At the bottom we have a tab `Advanced configuration` Click on this and extra configuration
options will appear.

As you probably noticed we used in our `Command` the macro `{MANUALINPUT}` this
will be used to gather information from a user prompt. This allows us to ask
the user to fill in the time he wants to place the host in maintenance.

- *Enable user input* : yes
- *Input prompt* : How many minutes do you want to place the host in maintenance ?
- *Input type* : String (A dropdown box can also be used in case you have a list of options)
- *Default string* : 60 (but we can use anything this will just be the default answer)
- *Input validation rule* : `(\d+)` (our regex in perl to only allow digits)
- *Enable confirmation* : yes
- *Confirmation text* : Are you sure ?

If everything went well you should end up with a similar looking page :

![Script form](ch09-script-form.png)

*9.6 Script form*

When your are ready press `Add` at the bottom of the form. Let's test our script
to see if it works.

### Testing the frontend script

In Zabbix go to the menu `Monitoring` => `Hosts` and click on the host `Zabbix server`
and from the `scripts` menu select `Maintenance` and click on the sub Menu
`Create maintenance no data collection`. You should see a popup asking you how 
many minutes you like to place the host in maintenance.

![Monitoring host](ch09-host-testing-script.png)

*9.7 Create maintenance*

When we click continue however we get a popup telling us that Zabbix cannot execute the script.

![error execute](ch09-error-execute-script.png)

*9.8 Error executing script*

This error is normal Zabbix has an option in the configuration file of the `Zabbix server`
and the proxy that blocks the execution of global scripts. 

We get a notification that `Zabbix` cannot execute the script. The config file
has an option to block global executions by default in the server or proxy config
activate the option "EnableGlobalScripts=1". Go to the `Zabbix server` configuration
file with you favourite editor and enable the parameter and restart the server service. 


If all goes well this time you will see a popup telling you it was successful this time.

![Maintenance ok](ch09-ok-execute-script.png)

*9.9 Maintenance successful*

When we look in our Zabbix menu under `Data collection` => `Maintenance` we can see
that a new maintenance was created for our host with the time we had specified.
This will allow us to create Maintenance windows for hosts from the frontend with
only a few clicks.

Even better we are now able to allow certain non `Admin` users to create `maintenance periods`
for hosts without the need to give special access rights or create special profiles.
We have in our config of our script the option to limit the use of this `frontend script`
to certain `Host groups` and `User groups`.

???+ Tip 
    You can now create the same script but add the option `yes` instead of `no`
    when it comes to data collection and you can also create a script to delete
    the maintenance period by just replacing `create` with `delete` and remove
    all options after "{HOST.HOST}". This way you are able to create `maintenance periods`
    and delete them when not needed anymore per host.

The ability to tailor Zabbix to your specific needs with frontend scripts is a
significant advantage. It allows you to automate repetitive tasks, streamline workflows,
and gain deeper insights into your infrastructure. Whether you're automating routine
checks, creating custom dashboards, or integrating with external systems, the
knowledge you've gained here will enable you to effectively leverage Zabbix.

Remember, the examples and techniques presented in this book provide a foundation.
The true power of Zabbix frontend scripts lies in their flexibility and your ability
to adapt them to your specific needs. As you continue to explore and experiment,
you'll discover new ways to enhance your monitoring capabilities and optimize
your Zabbix setup.
