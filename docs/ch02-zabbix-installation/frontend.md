# Frontend explained

This chapter is going to cover the basics we need to know when it comes to the
Zabbix user interface and the thing we need to know before we can start to fully
dive into our monitoring tool. We will see how the user interface works how to add
a host, groups users, items ... so that we have a good understanding of the basics.
This is something that is sometimes missed and can lead to frustrations not knowing
why things don't work like we had expected them to work. So even if you are an
advanced user it may be useful to have a look into this chapter.

Let's get started

## Overview of the interface

With Zabbix 7 the user interface after logging in is a bit changed. Our menu on
the left side of the screen has has a small overhaul. Let's dive into it.
When we login into our Zabbix setup the first time with our Admin user we see a page

like this where we have our `main window` in <font color='green'>green</font>
our `main menu` marked in
<font color='red'>red</font> and our `links` marked in <font color='gold'>yellow</font>.
