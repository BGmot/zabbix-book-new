# Some guidlines when writing chapters

1. Always start with # followed by the name of the chapter.
   
2. When creating lists use `**` before and after so it's in ***bold***

Example :

- **First** : my first item
- **Second** : my second item

3. When wat to place special emphasis on a word use \` before and after the word so it looks like
   `my special word`.
   
4. When you create a table always try to align the text in the table to the left.
   This can be doen with :---- as can be seen in next example

| column 1 | column 2 | colunn 3 |
| :----    | :----    | :----    |
|          |          |          |

5. When writing sentences try to keep them at a maximum lenght of `80` charcaters
   for visability.
   
6. If you like to add images just create a folder under the chapter folder with
   the name of your topic and place the `.png` file it. To reference to your image
   just add the name like `\!\[image name]\(name.png)` in your document. mkdocs will find
    the image by itself
   
7. Naming your images. Always use the following naming convention: `chxx-topic-imagename.png`.
